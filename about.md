Am a cricketer at heart and coder by profession. I follow all the international matches and some domestic games as well. Apart from cricket I follow English Premier League (Manchester United), La Liga (Barcelona), Formula One (Ferrari), Tennis (Roger Federer).  

### Background
  * Year of Birth: 1990
  * School: Kothakota Public School(till 6th grade), Annus Academy (6th until 10th)
  * Intermediate (+1 and 2 in some places): Narayana Junior College
  * Bachelors: Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology 
All these events have taken place in Telangana, India. Somewhere in the vicinity of Hyderabad. Now its already 2011.
  * First Job: Cognizant Technology Solutions (Chennai, India). Worked as a Mainframes programmer for 2 years. Mostly on COBOL and towards the later stage on Crystal Reports. 
  * Leap of Faith: In August 2013, I joined Masdar Institute of Science and Technology as a Master's student. 
I met a lot of people from different countries and one thing that would stay with me is a friend from Tibet asking me "how you people remember all the dance moves", he was referring to Bollywood songs and I had to explain that doesn't happen in real life.   
Also I met some people from Pakistan. Indians and Pakistanis we both almost speak the same language, watch the same movies, listen to same songs, mad about the same sport. Some day I wish to travel to Pakistan without a Visa (legally not like Bajrangi Bhaijaan though). 
  * Second Job: Its already 2015 and now am here in Serendio solving mostly Data Science problems.
